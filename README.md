- 👋 Hi, I’m @marcellusfarias
- 👀 I’m interested in backend software development, with experience developing highly microserving projects using Rust and MVC projects with C#.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Rust and different architecture principles so I can build the best possible projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can be used by thousands of people.
